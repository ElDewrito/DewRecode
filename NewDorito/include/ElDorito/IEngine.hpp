List of events registered by ED (eventNamespace/eventName seperated by a period):
	Core.Engine.FirstTick - signalled when the game engine loop starts ticking, only signals once
	Core.Engine.MainMenuShown - when the mainmenu is first being shown, only signals once after the game has inited etc
	Core.Engine.TagsLoaded - when the tags have been reloaded
	Core.Input.KeyboardUpdate - when a key is pressed (i think? haven't looked into keyboard code much)


	Core.Server.Start - when the user has started a server
	Core.Server.Stop - when the user has stopped the server
	Core.Server.PlayerKick - when a user has been kicked (host only)

	Core.Game.Joining - when the user is joining a game (direct connect cmd issued)
	Core.Game.Leave - when the user leaves a game
	Core.Game.End - when a game has finished (ez)


(soon):
    Core.Direct3D.Present - when the game is about to call D3DDevice::Present
	Core.Direct3D.EndScene - when the game is about to call D3DDevice::EndScene
	Core.Round.Start - when a round has started
	Core.Round.End - when a round has finished
	Core.Game.Join - when the user joins a game
	Core.Game.Start - when a game has started
	Core.Player.Join - when a user joins the game (signals for all users, not just host)
	Core.Player.Leave - when a user leaves the game (signals for all users, not just host) (ez)
	Fore.Twenty - when the kush hits you

later:
	Core.Lobby.ChangeMap
