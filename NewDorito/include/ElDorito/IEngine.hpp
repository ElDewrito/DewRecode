List of events registered by ED (eventNamespace/eventName seperated by a period):
	Core.Engine.FirstTick - signalled when the game engine loop starts ticking, only signals once

	Core.Engine.TagsLoaded - when the tags have been reloaded
	Core.Input.KeyboardUpdate - when a key is pressed (i think? haven't looked into keyboard code much)


	Core.Server.Start - when the user has started a server
	Core.Server.Stop - when the user has stopped the server
	Core.Server.PlayerKick - when a user has been kicked (host only)

	Core.Game.Joining - when the user is joining a game (direct connect cmd issued)
	Core.Game.Leave - when the user leaves a game
	Core.Game.End - when a game has finished (ez)


(soon):
