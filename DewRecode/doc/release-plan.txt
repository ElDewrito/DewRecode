Our first release of DewRecode (1.0) will include everything we'd promised for ElDewrito 0.5, and more. Releases will be done in four stages:

Stage 1 - Code is branched off for the new release, no new features can be added to this branch, only fixes.
Stage 2 - Internal/IRC/nightly testing is done, any bugs found will be fixed in the release branch. (lasts around 3-4 days)
Stage 3 - Update pushed to beta updater channel, people on the channel can try it out and report bugs to us (lasts around a week)
Stage 4 - Full release over updater, every user will be updated to the new build.

Using this system of stages helps us to make sure we don't have the feature-bloat problem of 0.5 again, and by doing several rounds of testing we can help be sure that we won't have the same headaches as the last week.

Some might think that this is a long time between releases (while in reality it'd probably be longer)
But note that once DewRecode's initial version is released there won't be much of a need for frequent updates.
DewRecode 1.0 will have the majority of things that people have asked for, further releases will mostly be bugfixes/fixes for the game and small unfinished features.
