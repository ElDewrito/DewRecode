All the lib files and headers needed to build are in the repo (include folder has to be at the HTML5Plugin root because of the weird way CEF headers include themselves...)
After building grab cef_binary_3.2171.1979_windows32.7z from their site
Then either copy the contents of the \cef_binary_3.2171.1979_windows32\Release folder or the contents of the \cef_binary_3.2171.1979_windows32\Debug folder depending on your build
Also copy the contents of the\cef_binary_3.2171.1979_windows32\Resources
^ copy to the root of your HO install

Todo:
- see if we can use CEF Release build with DR Debug (probably can)
- see which files we actually need to copy to the HO install
- get keyboard input + mouse clicks sent to CEF (probably need the input states code from ED)
- fix crashing on exit (probably not deleting something properly)
- add a lot more error checking
